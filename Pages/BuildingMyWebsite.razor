<h1>Building My Website</h1>

<p>
    My website is built using Microsoft's Blazor framework.
    Blazor allows me to create UI using C# instead of JavaScript, so both server-side and client-side logic can be written in .NET.
    The official documentation for Blazor can be found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>Hosting Model</h2>

<p>
    There are two models for hosting a Blazor app: Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly.
    I am using Blazor WebAssembly so that most of the processing required to run the website is offloaded to the client.
    Offloading the processing to the client allows a less powerful server to be used for hosting the website, which is cheaper.
    Also, once the Blazor WebAssembly app is downloaded into the browser, it should be more responsive than a Blazor Server app.
    This increase in responsiveness is achieved because most user interactions will not require any network hops under the Blazor WebAssembly model.
    The tradeoffs are that the initial loading of the website will take longer, low-end devices may struggle to run the website, and some browsers do not support WebAssembly apps.
